Analyzing the Performance Evolution of freeBSD Core Kernel Operations

A Thesis by Corey Scheinfeld

Advised by Professor Pete Johnson


-----------TODO-----------

* Measurement decision for operation latency.
	*KBest source description and reasoning.
*calculate min/max/avg/stddev/variance for understanding variance within 10k benchmark runs.
*code revisions for freeBench
	*look into what __syscall does with 64-bit return values from, eg, mmap
	*document differences between epoll's POLL_IN and kqueue's EVFILT_READ.
	*document differences between context_switch_test and parameters to sched_setaffinity and cpuset_setaffinity.
	*test intermediate syscalls for immediate return upon failure. 
	*modify poll_test and kqueue_test, to stay consistent with LEBench use of AF_INET sockets versus PF_UNIX sockets.


-----------TECHNICAL NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS-----------

EPOLL VS KQUEUE
